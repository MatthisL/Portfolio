# Let Me Introduce Myself
---

Hi, I am **Matthis** :wave:,<br>

I’ve been passionate about video games ever since I can remember. 
From a young age, I was not only fascinated by playing them, but also by the creative process behind them. 
That passion for creativity pushed me to explore beyond the screen ! 👨‍💻😊 
{: .text-justify}

When I was around 12 years old, my older brother and I launched a private server for Metin2 (thats so ooooold! It's a chinese MMORPG we played a lot when we were teenager 😅). 
{: .text-justify}

{: .text-center .text-muted}

That project was my first dive into the world of game development, and I was hooked. From there, I explored Minecraft modding in Java, playing with Arma 3 mods using Altis Life. Bohemia Interactive left a great place for modding with their scripting language [SQF](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Introduction_to_Arma_Scripting).

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Here is a cool mod I did to handle interest points on your map
</div>

I ended opening an Altis Life Roleplay server with a group of friend I met on a server and with which I was roleplaying 🤩 I was doing all the development/programming and maintenance of the server (I rememeber we reached 100+ players at a time!).
{: .text-justify}

I even got curious about cheat development, all driven by a desire to understand how games worked and how to go where we do not have the right to. 😈 
{: .text-justify}

*(PS : I never used them in official games because I didn't know anything about bypassing anti-cheat and I knew I would be flagged right away haha)*
{: .text-justify}

But my journey wasn’t a straight line. For a long time, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do with my life. I followed a traditional academic path through high school and higher education, trying out different programs like engineering school (INSA) and computer science at university, always searching for that thing that would finally click.
{: .text-justify}



# Epitech: Finding My Path
---

That moment came when I joined **Epitech**, a school where everything is project-based: no lectures, no professors giving you the answers. You’re expected to figure things out on your own, collaborate with your friends' promotion, and become self-reliant.

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/about/epitech-laval.jpg' | relative_url }}">

This environment suited me perfectly. I was already an autodidact with a strong sense of independence, but Epitech helped me sharpen essential skills like rigor, persistence, organization, teamwork, and professionalism. 
{: .text-justify}

It was also through Epitech’s many projects that I found my path: programming, especially when it came to games and anything graphical.
{: .text-justify}


# Breaking into Game Development
---

In my fourth year at Epitech, I had the opportunity to study abroad at **CSUSM** in San Marcos, California, but the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2019. Like many others, I had to return home in early 2020 before completing the second semester.
{: .text-justify}

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/about/csusm-campus.jpg' | relative_url }}">

{: .text-center .text-muted}

To make up for the lost time, Epitech offered us the chance to gain professional experience through internships, short-term contracts, or freelance work. That was the turning point, the opportunity to officially step into the video game industry.
{: .text-justify}

I registered as a freelancer and went looking for my very first mission. That’s how I joined **Drom Games**, a fantastic indie studio working on Unity. At first, I didn’t have any experience with Unity or C#, and after a technical test, they initially chose not to move forward with me.
{: .text-justify}

{% capture carousel_images %}
{{ '/assets/img/about/sayve-splashart.jpg' | relative_url }}
{{ '/assets/img/about/sayve-game.jpg' | relative_url }}
{% endcapture %}
{% include elements/carousel.html id="carousel-sayve" %}

But I wasn’t ready to give up. I believed in the project and in the team. So, I wrote a heartfelt letter to the studio’s founder explaining how motivated I was, how fast I could learn, and how much I wanted to be part of their journey.
{: .text-justify}

That determination paid off. They gave me a chance, and I made sure to make it count.
{: .text-justify}

I worked on Sayve, a mobile city-building and management game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Players must rebuild civilization while considering the ecological consequences of their actions, a meaningful and engaging concept that I was proud to contribute to. 
{: .text-justify}

One of the team members I had the privilege to work with was [Guillaume Kehren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-kehren/), former lead developer at Endnight Games, the studio behind The Forest. He taught me a lot, and we’ve kept in touch ever since.


# Balancing Work and Studies
---

When my 6-month mission with Drom Games came to an end, the collaboration had gone so well that they asked if I wanted to continue. The only catch? My fifth and final year at Epitech was about to start 😟.
{: .text-justify}

I chose to continue working with the studio full-time while managing my final year of studies on the side. It wasn’t always easy, but I was deeply fulfilled by the work and it also helped fund my education. I organized my schedule to attend school meetings when necessary, and I dedicated evenings and weekends to my academic projects.
{: .text-justify}

It was a challenging year, but it confirmed something important: I had finally found the path that made me feel truly alive.

<div class="alert alert-warning text-center" role="alert" style="font-size: 18px">
    From now on, I have specialized myself in Unreal Engine.<br/>
    I found in love with this engine and I'm always surprised in what it's capable of! <br/>
    Hurrah Unreal 🙌
